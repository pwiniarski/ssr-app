#Research Server side rendering to work with create react app

## Features:

* working server using express js
* created html template to fill with data and send in request
* read hashes from asset-manifest.json to fill hashes part in filenames generated by webpack
* set up Webpack config for server 

## ToDo:

### Server Side Set up

* fix webpack server config so build folder is correctly filled. Currently css is not generated 
* Although bundle.js file is created as result of webpack joining bundling chunks, there is get / bundle.js failed message.

### Server Side rendering
* Incorrect path for png file, most likely issue with incorrect set up of webpack config for server
* Implement Api calls on server side


### For script to work and run, dev script in npm need to be:
"react scripts build && webpack --config webpack.server.config.js && node server"
